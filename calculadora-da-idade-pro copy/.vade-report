# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the React-based age calculator application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` package to the project dependencies
- Installed using npm, which updated both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### 2. Code Integration
**Modified: App.tsx**
- Imported the `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/react`
- Added the `<SpeedInsights />` component to the main App component
- Component is placed at the root level of the app's return statement, ensuring it tracks all page views and performance metrics

### Implementation Details
The SpeedInsights component was added following Vercel's best practices for React applications:
- Import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';`
- Component placement: Added inside the main div wrapper, ensuring it loads with the application
- The component will automatically track Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB) and send data to Vercel's Speed Insights dashboard

## Verification
- ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
- ✅ Package installed correctly with all dependencies resolved
- ✅ No TypeScript errors introduced
- ✅ Application structure preserved

## Next Steps for Deployment
Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Speed Insights tab)
2. The `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js` route will be automatically available
3. Performance metrics will start appearing in the dashboard after users visit the site
